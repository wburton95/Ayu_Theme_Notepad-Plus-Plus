### Contribution

Basic support for lexers are working however not perfect. Many languages still require much tweaking. Please consider forking this project and improving language support by adding syntax highlighting for other lexers. Notepad++ is somewhat difficult to customize when it comes to themes but the editor is fully capiable of visual beauty and reduced eye strain with enough effort.
